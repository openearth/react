Operational implementation over SE-Asia: https://hydrafloods-servir.adpc.net/ (main page hangs a bit upon loading due to a bug, to be fixed when new SERVIR-SEA starts up, you can also go directly to the map https://hydrafloods-servir.adpc.net/map/)

Within SERVIR-SEA we'll continue developing HYDRAFloods. First up on the list are optical-SAR data fusion and improved water/flood depths.
